## Getting Started

Notes:

For firebase to work, these things needed to be changed:
1) Add code to settings.gradle (is marked)
2) Add the google-services.json
3) Add the GoogleService-Info.plist

To set up the Firebase auth and database, follow instructions on https://console.firebase.google.com/ -> Add App -> iOS or Android, or https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/flutter-firebase-setup
